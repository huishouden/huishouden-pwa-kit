/**
 * The asset CDN (docs/one-site.md "Asset CDN"): the suite's hashed build files (`<base>assets/*`:
 * JS, CSS, fonts, wasm, imported images) are served from a Cloudflare Worker with static assets
 * instead of Firebase Hosting, whose free plan has 10 GB of transfer a month for the whole suite.
 * Cloudflare serves static assets free and without a request limit. HTML, `sw.js`, the web
 * manifest and icons stay on Firebase, so the app's address, service worker scope and install
 * identity do not change; Firebase keeps a copy of every asset too, which the page falls back to.
 *
 * This module is the pure part: the CDN's addresses, its `_headers`, the Worker's config, which
 * earlier files a deploy keeps, and the page's fallback script. `pwa-site cdn` builds the upload
 * and the reusable workflow deploys it with wrangler, before Firebase deploys the HTML.
